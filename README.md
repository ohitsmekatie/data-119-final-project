# data-119-final-project

## Overview 

This repository contains all the files for FA2020 DAT-119 (Python 1 @ CCAC) final project as well as some followup analysis I did after the class. :tada:

This program analyzes data about Allegheny County's air quality from the years 1983, 2017, and 2019. If you'd like to see a manual analysis (done for DAT 102) you can check out [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tRfFuJj9IN90HBUoOphV2PV7lWzA6rPJSaZ9pUjpBUQ/edit) spreadsheet which contains source links and method steps. 

Since the data wasn't super compelling in my final projects I did some follow up on Nashville's air quality data for the same years (2019, 2017) and you can find that notebook here.

### Next steps for the project:
- Do a combined analysis of the 2 cities. This is coming :soon:!
